## Traffic Control System

This project implements a Traffic Light Control System on STM32 which controls 4 traffic lights at an intersection. The system dynamically adapts to vehicle presence and count.

### Features
- **Finite-State Machine (FSM):** Manages traffic light states and transitions for real-time control.
- **Dynamic Signal Timing:** Adjusts signal timing based on vehicle presence and count.
- **GPIO Interrupts:** Utilizes interrupt-driven button presses for vehicle counting.
- **RGB LED Control:** Drives traffic lights using GPIO outputs.<br>
- **Bare-Metal Firmware:** Implemented in C using direct register access for efficiency.<br>
